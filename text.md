General Points

The rubric is the only source of truth when it comes to performance assessments. The graders follow it religiously.

It is a good idea to ask for the welcome email before starting a course.

Also, old reddit posts are a gold mine of information so it's good to quickly check those before starting. If you can't find any reddit posts then the course is probably too new or the course name changed recently so there might be lots of posts just under a different name.

The Course Tips and the Course Chatter usually has pretty good information as well. If I am unsure about something and can't find the answer easily online I will email the Course Mentors.

Create a folder on your computer for each course and store any downloadable course material such as guides, templates, etc there. Also create a new bookmarks folder in your browser for each course to bookmark relevant web pages.

Introduction to IT – C182: Read the course materials and did all the interactive stuff.

Critical Thinking and Logic – C168: Read some of the course materials. Once I got a feel for what answers they were looking for I just wrote the PA and OA and passed.

English Composition I – C455: Have to write 4 essays. For sources I tried to use statistics from .gov and .org websites as much as possible. They are easy to find and use eg. The solar industry in the US grew 45% last year (Example.gov, 2017). Saved time instead of reading confusing academic journals looking for information to support my thesis.

Integrated Physical Sciences – C165: Read through the learning resource, did some quiz's on quizlet.

College Algebra – C278: Completed all the practise questions on the Hawkes learning site.

Introduction to Probability and Statistics – C459: Read through all the course material and did the practise problems. Did poorly on the section where you have to calculate probability with the formulas. Found the OA to be easier than the PA.

English Composition II – C456: It's just a really long essay. Chose 4 points to support my thesis statement. Tried a make each point a mini essay of 1-2 pages.

Introduction to Geography – C255: Skimmed through the learning material. Did some quiz's on quizlet.

Introduction to Communication – C464: The OA was just common sense to me. Didn't study at all for it. For the video presentation I just used one of my essay's but rewrote it on cue cards and changed the sentence structure so it flowed better while presenting.

IT Foundations – C393: The first part of the Comptia A+. Did all the practise questions on uCertify until I was getting 100% and then went to a testing center and wrote it.

Introduction to Humanities – C100: Took the PA open book. Once I got a the gist of the different periods eg. Romantic was all about hero's, Neoclassical was about ancient buildings, I just went ahead and wrote the OA and passed. The two written parts are very straightforward. Pick a topic you find interesting from the list they give you, research it, write about it.

Scripting and Programming - Foundations – C173: This course is very easy if you know how to code already. If not then it's pretty tough. Really have to understand how for loops and while loops work to follow the pseudocode they give you and choose the correct answer.

Network and Security - Foundations – C172: This course is brutal and was by far the hardest OA of the degree. There is a ton of information about a wide range of different networking technologies. The thing that made sub-netting click for me was to visualize ip address' in bits so. 128.168.2.1 = 10000000.10101000.00000010.00000001. Calculate it using https://www.watchguard.com/wgrd-resource-center/security-fundamentals/understanding-ip-addresses-and-binary. Once I understood that then calculating the network and broadcasting addresses was easy.

IT Applications – C394: Second part of the Comptia A+. Did the same thing just practised on uCertify until I was getting 100%.

Natural Science Lab – C683: Chose melting ice for my topic. Super easy to set up and just take photos as it is melting.

Organizational Behavior and Leadership – C484: Another easy common sense course. Looked over the key terms in the Course Tips Section a bit then wrote the PA and OA.

Web Development Applications – C777: Read through the course material on uCertify and took all the practise tests.

Technical Communication – C768: This course is pretty straightforward just two writing tasks. Follow the rubric to the letter to pass on the first try.

User Interface Design – C773: This course is pretty hard. Need 72% to pass and the questions are super annoying because every answer seems like it could be the right one. I did the practise tests on uCertify as well as reading all the actual material and still only passed by 2%.

Operating Systems for Programmers – C191: Another difficult course. Lots of complicated material. The Memory Management section is worth 32% of the exam so I spent extra time studying that material.

Principles of Management – C483: Can't remember, I think I just wrote it and passed no studying.

Business of IT - Applications – C179: There are a couple hard parts. Anything in the course material that follows a Step 1, Step 2, Step 3 format is probably going to be on the exam so it's worth memorizing.

Software Engineering – C188: Another written task. Similar to Technical Writing.

Business of IT - Project Management – C176: Comptia Project+. Read all the material on uCertify and did the practise tests. Understanding the differences between the different roles such as project sponsor and project manager is key.

Data Management - Foundations – C175, Data Management - Applications – C170, Data Management for Programmers – C192: These are all about Structured Query Language (SQL). I read through most of the course material and referenced the site W3Schools a 1000 times because it provides simpler explanations and sample code.

Scripting and Programming - Applications – C169: Have to write a test about Java and a small Java program. The book Java for Everyone - Late Objects is a great book and covers everything.

Software I – C482, Software II - Advanced Java Concepts – C195: These are pretty tough and time consuming applications to develop. The guides on this site: http://code.makery.ch/ cover most of the requirements. I also created checklists for each project to break them down into small tasks to stopped feeling overwhelmed.

Mobile Application Development – C196: For this course stick to using activities for the screens. Fragments just add unnecessary complication. The newboston tutorials on YouTube cover most of what is required.

Client-Server Application Development – C193: This course basically requires you to memorize Java's entire networking API. I powered through the material and kept doing the PA over until I felt comfortable. Still didn't do great on the exam but passed.

IT Capstone Written Project – C769: Had a code project already completed. Just wrote as much as I could about every little detail of it to get it to the required length.

And that's all of it. Hopefully it helps people in the future. Thanks again.
